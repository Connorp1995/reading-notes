# What is Growth Mindset?
Growth mindset in my opinion is using the will power within me to learn how to code and get the most out of this course as I possibly can.
3 things to remember how to stay in a growth mindset are to:
1. Reflect on what I have learned up to this point
2. Remember why I'm doing this
3. Remember that if something isn't difficult it would not be worth doing.

Hey my name is Connor, I am a student on the full stack course

# What is this website?
These are my reading notes for the full stack course bootcamp where I will become a coding wizard.

# What is Growth Mindset?
Growth mindset in my opinion is using the will power within me to learn how to code and get the most out of this course as I possibly can.
3 things to remember how to stay in a growth mindset are to:
### 1. Reflect on what I have learned up to this point.
***This is to remember how much knowledge I have gained since the start of the course.***
### 2. Remember why I'm doing this.
***Think back to why you have taken the time to take this course, to build a better future for yourself.***
### 3. Remember that if something isn't difficult it's usually not worth doing.
***Life changing decisions and career pivots are hard, but they're worth it.***
